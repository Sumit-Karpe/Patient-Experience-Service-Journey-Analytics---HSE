# Patient-Experience-Service-Journey-Analytics---HSE
This project analyzes patient experience and service journey data to identify key drivers of satisfaction, understand patient engagement behavior, and highlight operational bottlenecks within a healthcare service context.

# Objectives
Identify the strongest drivers of patient satisfaction<br>
Analyze differences in experience across demographic groups<br>
Examine patient progression through the healthcare service journey<br>
Translate analytical findings into actionable business recommendations<br>

# Tools & Technologies
Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)<br>
SQL (joins, aggregations, funnel analysis)<br>
Power BI (interactive dashboards and storytelling)<br>

# Dataset Description
The analysis uses three synthetic datasets designed to reflect realistic healthcare service and survey patterns:<br>
patients_demographics.csv – demographic and socioeconomic attributes<br>
patient_experience_surveys.csv – patient satisfaction and experience scores<br>
patient_service_funnel.csv – step-level service journey records<br>
All data is fully synthetic and privacy-safe.<br>

# Key Analyses Performed
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)<br>
Correlation and driver analysis<br>
Demographic segmentation<br>
Time-based trend analysis<br>
Service journey funnel analysis<br>

# Key Insights
Communication quality and timeliness are the strongest drivers of patient satisfaction<br>
Older patients exhibit slightly lower satisfaction and higher funnel drop-off<br>
The largest disengagement occurs between appointment scheduling and attendance<br>
Higher satisfaction strongly correlates with recommendation behavior<br>

# Recommendations
Improve appointment attendance through reminders and scheduling optimization<br>
Prioritize communication-focused service improvements<br>
Increase survey engagement, particularly among older patient groups<br>
