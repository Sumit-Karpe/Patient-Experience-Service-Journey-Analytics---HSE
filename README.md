# Patient-Experience-Service-Journey-Analytics-HSE
This project analyzes patient experience and service journey data to identify key drivers of satisfaction, understand patient engagement behavior, and highlight operational bottlenecks within a healthcare service context.

Objectives of this project<br>
1. Identify the strongest drivers of patient satisfaction<br>
2. Analyze differences in experience across demographic groups<br>
3. Examine patient progression through the healthcare service journey<br>
4. Translate analytical findings into actionable business recommendations<br>

Dataset Description<br>
The analysis uses three synthetic datasets designed to reflect realistic healthcare service and survey patterns:<br>
patients_demographics.csv – demographic and socioeconomic attributes<br>
patient_experience_surveys.csv – patient satisfaction and experience scores<br>
patient_service_funnel.csv – step-level service journey records<br>
All data is fully synthetic and privacy-safe. The datasets were generated using AI based on the input available through HSE's job listing.<br>

Key Insights<br>
Communication quality and timeliness are the strongest drivers of patient satisfaction<br>
Older patients exhibit slightly lower satisfaction and higher funnel drop-off<br>
The largest disengagement occurs between appointment scheduling and attendance<br>

Higher satisfaction strongly correlates with recommendation behavior<br>
